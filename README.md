Implementing ROS with OpenCV using CV_Bridge in both Python and C++  
Includes:  
1. OpenCV Basics  
2. Bridging OpenCV and ROS  
3. Adaptive Thresholding  
4. Color Filtering  
5. Tennis Ball Detection  

SIDE NOTE:: Sphereical objects are excellent for learning OpenCV and image tracking/detection becuase the 2D image projection is
constant as the ball rotates. Only distance from the lense must be accounted for
